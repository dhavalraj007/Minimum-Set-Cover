# Minimum-set-cover
Implementation of Minimum Set cover problem using two approaches.
1. Greedy approach. See [Greedy.cpp](https://github.com/dhavalraj007/Minimum-set-cover/blob/master/LP_test/Greedy.cpp)
2. Linear programming with Repeat randomized rounding. see [LpRandom.cpp](https://github.com/dhavalraj007/Minimum-set-cover/blob/master/LP_test/LpRandom.cpp)
